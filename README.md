# commerce_heroku
An eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a watchlist.

- Create Listing: Users can create a new listing by specifying a title for the listing, a text-based description, and what the starting bid should be. Users can also optionally provide a URL for an image for the listing and/or a category (e.g. Fashion, Toys, Electronics, Home, etc.).
- Active Listings Page: Display all the active listings
- Listing Page: Clicking on a listing will take users to a page specific to that listing where all details about the listing, including the current price for the listing are available.
- A signed in user can bid for a listing, add it to a watchlist, and if the user is the one who created the listing, then he can also close the listing when he gets a satisfactory bid.
- A winners list is displayed to all signed-in users where the details of the winners are available.
